# Investigating Oil vs BigTech stock

In this project, the skills acquired from advanced data wrangling course are applied to gather and wrangle real-world data with two datasets. They are retrieved and extractd, then assessed programmatically and visually, accross elements of data quality and structure, and a cleaning strategy for the data was implemented. Then the updated data is stored into the directiry ./data as a data store, combined the data, and tried to answer a research question with these datasets.
